# Bayesian Sports Models

A Python implementation of the concepts and models from Andrew Mack's book "Bayesian Sports Models in R".

## Overview

This repository contains Python implementations of the Bayesian sports modeling techniques presented in Andrew Mack's book "Bayesian Sports Models in R". While the original book uses R, these projects demonstrate the same statistical concepts and modeling approaches using Python.

## About the Book

"Bayesian Sports Models in R" by Andrew Mack provides a comprehensive introduction to applying Bayesian statistics to sports analytics and betting. This repository serves as a Python companion to the book's concepts.

## Projects Included

- **2024-2025 NFL Betting Model** - Advanced NFL betting predictions using Bayesian methods
- **MLB Hits Prediction** - Machine learning models for predicting MLB hit outcomes  
- **March Madness Project** - NCAA basketball tournament prediction models
- **Props Lines Tracker** - Sports betting props tracking and analysis
- **Research Papers** - Academic research in sports analytics
- **Various Data Challenges** - Including Best Ball Data Bowl and SABR Research

## Key Differences from the Book

- **Language**: Python instead of R
- **Libraries**: Uses Python equivalents (pymc, arviz, pandas, numpy, scipy)
- **Implementation**: Modern Python workflows and best practices
- **Extensions**: Additional projects beyond the book's scope

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install required Python packages: `pip install pymc arviz pandas numpy scipy matplotlib seaborn`
3. Navigate to specific project folders for detailed documentation
4. Check individual project README files for setup instructions

## Technologies Used

- **Bayesian Inference**: PyMC, ArviZ
